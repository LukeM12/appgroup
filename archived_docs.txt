ERROR MODULE FOR API
--------------------
Correlation of graph concepts required 
New Pathfinding algorithm
Testing module 1st priority - 300 lines of code. 
Cycles, 

If there is not 300+ lines of code per person. This is not done.
I will not give step by step instructions. Half of this problem is being
creative on how to test a graph.


FINE TUNING THE MAP
------------------------

Experimentation with the look of the map. 
The APP aesthetics and unit testing 
try a 45 degrees view, where we can actually see the buildings
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/aerial-simpled

Do a few other things to test that. 

This job is responsible for making the app work more efficiently, amking the map more detailed while keeping the simplistic format, and having 300+ lines fo code per person to have options. Not all options will be used. Just one, but we want them all avaialb.e

Testing should be alternated.

TUNNELS
--------
Make them work. 
Test them.
Should be less then 200 lines of code.
